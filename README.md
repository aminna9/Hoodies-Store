# Hoodies-Store

Our project idea is to develop an online system for the "Hoodiez Store", a store that sells hoodies. We thought of this online application for a shop, as we knew that we would be able to implement almost all of the knowledge gained from this course. 
Throughout this project, many functionalities were implemented, which include:
- Graphical user interface (GUI), to make the system attractive from the user’s point of view.
- User interface controls (UI) are used to allow the user to interact with the system. Each control has a particular purpose.
- Integration of a database to store all user data and offer organized data storage.
- Exception handling using try-catch, ensures that a message box is displayed in the event of an unexpected error caused by the user.
- Usage of “Save As” dialog box, to save user’s data.
- Animation, which uses timer control, is added to the system to enhance the user experience and make it attractive.
- “ToUpper” and “ToLower” are implemented to format the data that the user enters.
- The integration of ".Show()" and "this.Hide()" allows users to navigate between forms by just clicking on a button.
- "messageBox.Show()" provides feedback on what went wrong to the user in the event that they encounter any issues.
- The notion of constraint HCI design is applied, meaning that the user cannot submit an order or view an invoice unless all required information is filled out accurately.
- Input validation took a big part of our code, as we made sure for all parts that the user interacts with, there are input validations, in order to prevent errors.
